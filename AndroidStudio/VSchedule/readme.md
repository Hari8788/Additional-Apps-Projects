# VSchedule - Task Manager

## What is VSchedule?
- This application allows users to keep track of tasks. These tasks include a description and the desire time to the notification. Every task can be deleted. 

- This app is my first introduction to AndroidStudio. The end goal is to get experience with the implemention of such idea, which will be develop in the future to aid-App for people with disabilities that need such help with remembering those daily tasks.
